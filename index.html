        <h2>About Me</h2>


        <p>
            I'm originally from Bothell, Washington and I went to Kamiak High School after I graduated I joined the Air Force due to my family history. 
            The biggest factor that played a part in my decison to join was because of my grandpa who served in the Navy during WWII I've traveled quite 
            a bit. The most interesting place I ever visited was Greenland it was beautiful but really cold! Every morning I woke up I'd go outside and look 
            at the Ice Caps which are absolutely astonishing. After I separated I had to find a new life plan that will benefit me and the future I want to 
            have. Working with technology has always been on my mind and I like the ability it gives me and many others to develop and implement new material
            that could potentially help people out in the future. If would like to talk more feel free to message me in slack.
